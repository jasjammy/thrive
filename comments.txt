Implementation
  I chose to implement this exercise using classes.
  I made the program run using objects as it was easier to test
    and run this way
  If I had more time, I would have tested the presence and validation
    of the inputs.

Thoughts
  I instinctively wanted to use Rails. As it would make alot of the
  code alot easier to understand and implement.
    - The json files could easily have been translated to records in the
      database.
    - The challenge.rb would have been a service that made the output.txt.
    - validations and presence in input would have been much easier as it would have
      been taken care by ActiveRecord.

  I did not have too much time to pivot and implement it this way.
